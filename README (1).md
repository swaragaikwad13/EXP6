**EXP 6_a - Min** = In IPMV, the Min filter replaces each pixel value with the minimum value of its neighboring pixels. This filter is useful for removing bright noise or outliers in an image. By selecting the minimum value, the filter helps to darken the image and reduce the impact of bright noise.
**EXP 6_b - Median** = The Median filter replaces each pixel value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. This filter is effective in removing salt and pepper noise, which are random bright or dark pixels in an image. The median filter helps to preserve the edges and details in an image, resulting in a more accurate and visually appealing representation.
**EXP 6_c - Max** = In IPMV, the Max filter replaces each pixel value with the maximum value of its neighboring pixels. This filter is useful for removing dark noise or outliers in an image. By selecting the maximum value, the filter helps to brighten the image and reduce the impact of dark noise.
